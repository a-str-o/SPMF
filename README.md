# About
(Direct from the website project)

SPMF is an open-source data mining mining library written in Java, specialized in pattern mining.

It is distributed under the GPL v3 license.

It offers implementations of 133 data mining algorithms for:
- association rule mining,
- itemset mining,
- sequential pattern mining,
- sequential rule mining,
- sequence prediction,
- periodic pattern mining, 
- high-utility pattern mining,
- clustering and classification,
- time-series mining.

The source code of each algorithm can be easily integrated in other Java software.

Moreover, SPMF can be used as a standalone program with a simple user interface or from the command line.

SPMF is fast and lightweight (no dependencies to other libraries).

The current version is v2.18 and was released the 6th August 2017.
